This section describes the three major components of the \sys system architecture (\Cref{fig:arch}), split between the user interface to specify the cleaning problem, the core search algorithm, and optimization of the resulting cleaning program.  We focus on the interface and program optimization in this section, and focus on the search component and its optimizations in the rest of the paper.

The {\it Specification Interface} takes as input domain-specific cleanliness measures and data cleaning operations that the user provides  and translates them into a quality function and data transformation language.   For instance, our current implementation supports a wide range of quality functions including: attribute type constraints, functional dependencies, denial constraints, lookup tables~\cite{}, parametric and non-parametric outlier models, and correlations between numeric attributes.  Our existing cleaning data transformations primarily focus on conditional cell and record transformations that apply a transformation to all cells or records that satisfy a predicate; both the transformation parameters and the predicate are learned by \sys.  \Cref{s:appendix} provides a detailed description of the supported functions and extendible API. 

The {\it Search} component takes as input $Q$ and $L$, and performs a greedy search heuristic to find a program $p^* \in L$ that maximizes $Q$.  Users can supply hints that exploit the problem structure to reduce the runtime by pruning the search space and parallelizing the search.  To bound the search space, users specify a maximum program length $k$.    \sys also supports two main classes of pruning-based optimizations. {\it Static} rules that invalidate programs in $L$ that are unlikely to be useful.  For instance, composing the same idempotent transformation (e.g., \texttt{find\_replace(SFO, SF, city\_name)}) is redundant and can be immediately skipped.  {\it Dynamic} rules have access to the result of a candidate program when making pruning decisions, and we propose a novel approach to learn automatic dynamic pruning rules that can reduce end-to-end runtimes by up to \ewu{XXX} at the expense of slightly lower recall.  \Cref{s:search} describes the pruning rules and parallelization optimization in detail.


Finally, once search component outputs the cleaning program $p^*$, the {\it Program Optimizer} optimizes $P^*$ provides an API to apply simple query compilation techniques.  \sys currently replaces variables with literal values whenever possible.  In addition, we implement loop fusion~\cite{} to avoid scanning the input and intermediate relations for each transformation in $p^*$. Finally, we inline the data transformation functions into the loops.    

For example, consider the operations from~\Cref{ex3}.  Since the \texttt{find\_replace} operations do not conflict, it is inefficient to loop through over the relation instance three separate times.  
Since they do not conflict, it would be inefficient to execute them sequentially and iterate over the data three separate times.
Instead, one should combine the operations together and execute at once:
\begin{lstlisting}
    for r in rows:
     if r[city_name] == `New York':
       r[city_name] = `New York City'
     elif r[city_name] == `San Francisc':
       r[city_name] = `San Francisco'
     if r[city_code] == `NYC'
       r[city_code] = `NY'
\end{lstlisting}
We find that even these simple optimizations improve the final program runtime by \ewu{XXX}, and leave further improvements to future work.


% The user can optionally provide custom quality functions and data transformations as simple Python class definitions.      takes as input user specifications of the quality function and data transformation language, alongside search configuration parameters.

Now, we will overview some of the preliminary concepts and describe how this formalism inspires a modular system API.
\sys is designed as a software stack with three layers: a specification layer, a search layer, and an execution layer.
To understand how these layers interact, we will use the example in Section 2 throughout this section.


\subsection{Specification Layer} The provides an API for specifying a quality function and a language of transformations. This allows one to specify a data cleaning problem for a particular dirty instance. As described in the previous section, we provide an API for translating common data cleaning specifications, constraints, statistical models, and gold standard examples, into quality functions. 

The harder problem is specifying the language. 
The challenge is that most data transformations are parametrized by literal values from the database.
We need efficient techniques to automatically enumerate this transformation set before we apply the search.
The language is generated through a transformation templates which are dynamically populated by literals in the database.
A template is a parametrized transformation:
\[T(R, [\theta_1, \theta_2,...,\theta_k] ): \mathcal{R} \mapsto  \mathcal{R},\] where the parameters $[\theta_i]$ are populated by literal values.
Each $\theta_i$ represents an SQL query except for special parameters such as attribute names and data-independent hyperparameters.
The system dynamically generates all possible literal instances of this transformation by taking the cartesian product of the query results.

In the running example, consider the following function:
\[
\textsf{find\_replace}(\text{source}, \text{target}, \text{attribute})
\]
\begin{lstlisting}
source := SELECT attribute from R;
target := SELECT attribute from R;
\end{lstlisting}
Likewise for numerical transformations, consider the function that clips outlier values outside 6 standard deviations of the mean:
\[
\textsf{clip}(\text{mean}, \text{threshold})
\]
\begin{lstlisting}
mean := SELECT mean(attribute) from R;
threshold := SELECT 6*std(attribute) from R;
\end{lstlisting}
\sys provides queries and filters for a number of common parametrizations or they can be specified manually.

\subsection{Search Layer (Section 5)} The next layer is the search layer, which implements the basic search algorithm of \sys. This algorithm is a distributed best-first greedy search.  
With no additional information, the search approach described would have to evaluate $61^3 = 226981$ transformations, which is clearly impractical even for this small example.
This layer also provides an interface for custom search optimizations:
