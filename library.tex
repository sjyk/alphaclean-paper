\section{Specification Layer}
This layer translates a formal data model into a data cleaning specification.

\subsection{Synthesizing Quality Functions}
First, we describe how we translate existing data cleaning model into quality functions for use in \sys.

\subsubsection{Constraint-Based Data Cleaning}

\subsubsection{Model-Based Data Cleaning}

\subsubsection{Programming By Demonstrations}


\subsection{Library Generation}
Given a relation $R$, we populate the library with feasible literal values.

\subsubsection{Transformation API}
Data transformations are specified in terms of templates that can take different types of literal parameters.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Value
    \item Column
    \item Predicate
    \item Substring
\end{enumerate}

We provide a large set of these templates but users can write their own too.


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Library gets large
    \item Hints from quality functions about columns and predicates
    \item Note how these optimizations are similar to those in Scorpion.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Blocking}
Another approach to reduce the library size is to partition the relation into smaller logical blocks.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can sometimes be inferred from quality function.
    \item Similar to what is done in entity resolution.
\end{enumerate}
