The analyst effort in data cleaning is gradually shifting away from the design of hand-written scripts to building and tuning complex pipelines of automated data cleaning libraries.
Tuning such pipelines differs from popular hyperparameter tuning approaches since data cleaning operations are not as opaque as the parameters in machine learning. This paper proposes a framework, called \sys, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines.
\sys provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries.
\sys applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined method suggests candidate transformations to a dataset, which are asynchronously loaded into a queue, and in a separate thread, a search algorithm sequences them into a data cleaning plan to maximize the user-defined quality measures.
This architecture allows \sys to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to cut the search space.
Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that \sys finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods and is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library.
